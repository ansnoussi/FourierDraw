# FourierDraw
draw images with the help of Fourier series

## My aim here is to recreate something I saw on the internet

this is a gif I saw on 9gag with the title 
### 'Using epicycles and Fourier series, you can get an amazing automatic drawing generator'
![Alt Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansnoussi/FourierDraw/master/image.gif)

the title gives away a couple of hints: Epicycles , Fourier series
and I already have a good idea ,or so I think, about Fourier series
so in this repo I will try to document the thought process I went through.

##Final result
