I FOUND A GOLD MINE !!!!

so today, one of my favourite channels on youtube: SmarterEveryDay posted a video
titles: "What is a Fourier Series? (Explained by drawing circles) - Smarter Every Day 205"
link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds0cmAV-Yek
it talks EXACTLY about the goal I want to achieve! how to draw something using Fourier series

he talks in the video about a turkish blogger who achieved this idea using using a program 
called "mathematica" (I currently have no idea what that is, but that's how things work ! 
I'm here to learn) and then he exports the result to a gif!

so now instead of trying to do all the maths by my own, it would be better to abandon the idea 
of a java gui, and make a python app to automate this process, maybe this "mathematica" offers 
an API, or maybe I'll only make a script that will convert pictures to ones that can be read by 
the program

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
so, unfortunately I looked up mathematica on google and it turns out to be one of walfram's paid
products, (I don't even know if the company is called walfram or walfram alpha, all I know that it's
wonderfull mathematics resouce that helped me multiple times during my studies)
so that's one opetion to eliminate !! :'(

but from there on, things kept on getting better and better! 
I remembred a video I watched on MY FAVOURITE MATHS CHANNEL ON YOUTUBE (no joke) : 3blue1brown
that explains fourier series the best way possible! it's truely not only a video but a piece of art!

and then, things kept on getting better, again, one of the best youtube channels: theCodingTrain
made a live stream on this exact same topic !!! it's that AWESOME  !!!

so now, after all these happy coincidences, I think I will make this project using the p5js
and that way I get to learn a new language during this small project! :)
