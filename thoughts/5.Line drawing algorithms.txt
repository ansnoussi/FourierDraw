first I have to turn images into closed curves, so I can apply the Fourier
Series, for that I took a quick look at known Line drawing algorithms found
on wikipedia, and here are some of them:


A naive line-drawing algorithm:

Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm:

Bresenham's line algorithm:

Digital differential analyzer:

Gupta-Sproull algorithm:
nothing on wikipedia yet (maybe chose this algorithm and then post about on wikipedia? ;) )

also, I think it's best to take a look at edge detection algorithms as well:

I simply think that I'm the luckiest person alive! (or being spied on) 
Just as I started doing this simple project, so many creative and awesome people
on the internet started a similar topics: for example the coding train youtube 
channel which made the exact same thing I wanted to do with p5js,
so what I did was to write the same code shown in the live stream because its's
so satisfying.

what I'm thinking about right now is to update the README.md file with all the 
AMAZING work I found on the internet while I was doing my research and I'll call
it a day.
