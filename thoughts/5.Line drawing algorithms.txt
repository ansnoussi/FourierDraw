first I have to turn images into closed curves, so I can apply the Fourier
Series, for that I took a quick look at known Line drawing algorithms found
on wikipedia, and here are some of them:


A naive line-drawing algorithm:

Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm:

Bresenham's line algorithm:

Digital differential analyzer:

Gupta-Sproull algorithm:
nothing on wikipedia yet (maybe chose this algorithm and then post about on wikipedia? ;) )

also, I think it's best to take a look at edge detection algorithms as well:
