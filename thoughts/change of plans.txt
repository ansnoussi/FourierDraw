I FOUND A GOLD MINE !!!!

so today, one of my favourite channals on youtube: SmarterEveryDay posted a video
titles: "What is a Fourier Series? (Explained by drawing circles) - Smarter Every Day 205"
link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds0cmAV-Yek
it talks EXACTLY about the goal I want to acheive! how to draw something using Fourier series

he talks in the video about a turkish blogger who acheived this idea using using a program
called "mathimatica" (I currently have no idea what that is, but that's how things work ! I'm here to learn)
and then he exports the result to a gif!

so now instead of trying to do all the maths by my own, it would be better to abanden the idea
of a java gui, and make a python app to automate this process, maybe this "mathimatica" offers
an API, or maybe I'll only make a script that will convert pictures to ones that can be read by 
the program
