I'm not done with the gui yet, but I had an idea about how drawing is going to occur,
and I had to write it down.

at first, I was sure how I'm going to synchronize between the x and y axis.
but I really don't need to do that, it's not the circles that draw the image !! it's the
image who commands the circles !!!
so SIMPLY all i have to do is make a continuous trajectory on the image, and then project
that point on both axies and then consider that projection of that point on a given axies
is a continuous periodic path, so we could apply fourier series on it ! 
*of course all of this is done before head (before showing anything to the user)*

SOOO... we have two periodic composite functions (with the same initial phase) that if we
had each one running on an axis, and trace the trajectory taken by their intersection, 
we would get .... A DRAWING
