So to start off, I wanted a good way to save what learn each time I work on this.
I'll be keeping notes here, devided by 'chapters' so I don't get sloppy.
Not the best way, I know, but maybe someday I'll create a blog and post this there.


In this first 'chapter' I'll list all I know and try to analyse how the Gif I saw was done:

1- first, what I know about Fourier series from my studies is that it's used to devide a
composite signal (different fequencies) to different simple signals (each simple signal
have a precise frequency) each of them multiplied by a factor (to tell how much that exact
frequency effects the whole signal):
so, what it's clear that the composite signal is the whole drawing, while the simple ones
are the represented by the circles,the speed at which a circle is revolving must be due to
it's frequency, and it's radius must be due to the factor it's multiplied by.
I won't bother with going back to my notebook to look for the formula for Fourier series,
since in any language I'll be choosing to accomplish this project will probably have a
built-in Fourier series calculator.

second, Epicycles: I don't have a big idea about this one, but I know it have something to
do with connected circles, like a way for them to revolve arround each other, so if I have
to guess, it's a way to represent simple frequencies using cercles.


2- when I first saw this gif, I over simplified it by thinking the image will be devivded
to 2 signals (X axis and Y axis) and then work on each independent one, and maybe that's
true, but then you notice that the whole drawing is done using one single line, so even if the drawing will be devided to 2 dementions and then work on each, there must be some kind
of synchronization between them.

3- choice of language: I don't recall doing any kind of gui before, so I have no idea what
language to go for, but since I'm new to java I think I'm going to be using it to
accomplish this task


so my next step is taking a look at how to make a gui using java and make the basic
template for my program.
