so, the first step is to lay the ground for the rest of the application, by building a 
simple GUI
I didn't want to spend time learning how to build a gui and forget my main goal, that's why 
I downloaded a template from the internet and tried to understand it
link for template:
https://www.thoughtco.com/example-java-code-for-building-a-simple-gui-application-2034066

what I got from examening the code is:
there is a main frame to build the other frames on top: JFrame
then there are a couple of JPanels which will hold some basic 'componenets' like JButtons 
and we will switch between them by using the method setVisible().
